            Origami is the art of paper-folding. 
            Its name derives from Japanese words ori (“folding”) and kami 
            (“paper”).Traditional origami consists of folding a single sheet of 
            square paper(often with a colored side) into a sculpture without 
            cutting, gluing, taping, or even marking it.
